# **Object Detection from Image: Learning Project**

## **Project Description**
This project is my **first Computer Vision (CV) project**, created as a hands-on exploration of OpenCV's capabilities. It serves as an introduction to deep learning-based object detection, helping me **delve into the world of CV** while learning how to preprocess images, apply detection models, and visualize results.

The project automates object recognition by using a **pre-trained SSD MobileNet V3 model**, detecting multiple objects in a static image and labeling them with bounding boxes.

## **Algorithms Used**
### **Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD)**
SSD is a **deep learning object detection algorithm** designed for speed and efficiency. Unlike region-based methods, SSD predicts bounding boxes **in a single forward pass**, making it suitable for real-time applications.

### **MobileNet V3**
MobileNet V3 is a **lightweight CNN-based model**, optimized for mobile and edge devices. It balances **speed and accuracy**, making it effective for real-time object detection without requiring heavy computational resources.

## **Key Learnings**
- **Using pre-trained models** for object detection in OpenCV (`cv2.dnn`).
- **Configuring deep learning models** for optimized performance.
- **Bounding box filtering techniques** for better visualization.
- **Handling real-world detection challenges** in a structured way.
